# Splunk-Based SIEM System

## Project Overview
This project develops a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Splunk. It aims to aggregate security data from multiple sources, provide real-time analysis, alert on potential security incidents, support forensic investigations, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## Tech Stack
- **Splunk Cloud**: Central platform for data ingestion, analysis, and alerting.
- **Splunk SPL**: Search Processing Language for querying and event correlation.
- **Security Data Sources**: Includes firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, system logs, etc.
- **Automation Tools**: Scripts and integrations for automated response.
- **Compliance Modules**: For generating compliance reports.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Aggregates data from diverse security-relevant sources.
- **Event Correlation**: Uses complex SPL queries to identify potential security threats.
- **Alerting System**: Real-time alerts for quick incident response.
- **Forensic Tools**: Detailed data analysis capabilities for post-incident investigations.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Custom reports to assist in meeting regulatory requirements.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Configure Data Sources**: Set up log forwarding from all security devices to Splunk.
2. **Define SPL Queries**: Create advanced SPL queries for event correlation and alerting.
3. **Establish Alert Mechanisms**: Configure alerts to notify on detection of suspicious activities.
4. **Integrate Automated Response**: Connect Splunk with security orchestration tools to automate incident responses.
5. **Deploy Compliance Reports**: Set up and schedule compliance reports as per regulatory requirements.
